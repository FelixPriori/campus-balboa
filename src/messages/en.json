A great DJ will be able to determine the best choice of tempo depending on the situation, and dancers present.

It is impossible to please everybody, so it is imperative that the DJ reads the room and uses their judgement.",

In particular, the average level of the dancers present, the quality of the dance floor, the size of the dance floor, the energy level of the room, the timing (start of the evening, end of the evening, start of the set, end of the set), and much more. It is generally recommended to gradually increase and decrease the speed rather than going from one extreme to the other. A fast song played directly after a slow song will sound much faster in contrast, and vice versa. On the other hand, a dance floor that has little energy can benefit from a faster song. Similarly, a dance floor that's too tired for fast songs might regain some vigor after a slow song. This is why it is important to adapt to the people in the room, and every DJ will do this differently.",
