A great DJ will be able to determine the best choice of tempo depending on the situation, and dancers present. Variety and sense of timing is what makes an exceptional set: a set that only stays within the “sweet spot” will be boring, playing slow songs too often might kill the energy of the room, and playing too many fast songs might tire out the dancers. It is impossible to please everybody, so it is imperative that the DJ reads the room and uses their judgement.",
